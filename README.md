# Coffee Machine Simulator Project

## Project Overview
The Coffee Machine Simulator is a Python-based interactive program that emulates the operations of a professional coffee vending machine. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles while providing a practical, real-world application simulation.

## Technical Implementation
The project is built using Python and implements a class-based structure to manage the coffee machine's operations. The program utilizes dictionaries for menu and resource management, incorporating type hints for better code maintainability and understanding. Key technical features include resource tracking, monetary transactions, and user input validation.

## Core Functionality
The simulator offers three beverage options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Each drink requires specific amounts of resources (water, milk, and coffee) and has a set price. The program manages:
- Resource monitoring and deduction
- Coin processing (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
- Change calculation and return
- Maintenance reporting

## User Interaction
Users can:
- Select from available beverages
- Input coins for payment
- Request resource reports
- Turn off the machine
The interface provides clear feedback through formatted messages and status updates, ensuring a smooth user experience.
